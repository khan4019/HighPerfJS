### Boost JS Performance
-------
If you have to write much more than several lines of JavaScript in a script tag. And you have burned by “long running script” warning or “your page sucks, fix it or leave the job” or get a mini heart-attack every time you see HR walking towards your desk at 4.30 pm. Or you bought, “High Performance JavaScript” book but that improved your credit score only. Then let’s talk about the ways to improve performance of JavaScript code.



In this talk, Md Khan will be talking about the common area of performance holes while you are building an application with JavaScript. Things you should consider to avoid. Critical/ confusing parts of JavaScript you need to understand to make your own standard or so called best practices. How to optimize and debug run-time as well as network performance. If time permits, will cover how browser works and css optimization.



Finally, “The fastest development is not the fastest application” and “Don’t trust a rule, trust your tool”.
